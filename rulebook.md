# Leaving Earth Rulebook

The year is nineteen fifty-six. Mankind stands at the dawn of a new age, the Space Age, when the flying bombs of yesteryear will become the rocket ships of the race for tomorrow. As the director of a national space program, your country is depending on you for success in this great contest. You may be the first to create an artificial satellite, send a probe to another planet, or even put a man on the moon. Leaving Earth™ is a game about planning and about managing risk. With even a single grand journey into outer space, you might claim victory. Therefore, it is your job to plan each journey carefully, finding the cheapest, quickest, and safest ways to reach your objective — but do not spend too long preparing, or another nation might get there before you.

## 1. Basics of Rocketry

This is a game about moving spacecraft from one location to another. To demonstrate, we shall require a spacecraft and a few locations

Key points • components • locations • mass • thrust • maneuver difficulty

### 1.1 SPACECRAFT

A spacecraft begins with a spacecraft card. Each of these cards has a corresponding spacecraft token. Find a spacecraft card and its token and set them on the table. By itself, a spacecraft card is not very useful; it represents a craft with no rockets, no capsules, no astronauts, no moon rocks — nothing at all! To be useful, it requires components. Look through the component cards to find a probe and three Juno rockets and place them on the table. Take the probe and just one of the Juno rockets and stack them on top of the spacecraft card. Leave the other two rockets aside for now.

### 1.2 LOCATIONS 

Location cards represent places a spacecraft can go. Find the locations Lunar Orbit and Moon, then place them on the table.* The demonstration spacecraft begins in orbit around the moon, so place its token on the card labeled Lunar Orbit. A spacecraft card shows what a craft is made of, while a spacecraft token shows where the craft is.

### 1.3 MASS & THRUST 

A component's mass is shown in the upper left corner. This shows how heavy it is, but more importantly, it shows how hard it is to move. Propelling a spacecraft is like pushing a car — a light car is easy to get rolling, while a heavy car takes much more effort. Juno rockets and probes each have a mass of one, therefore the spacecraft sitting in front of you has a mass of two: one from the probe and one from the Juno rocket. Rockets and thrusters provide thrust , shown in the lower right corner. This shows how hard the component can push, propelling a spacecraft from one location to another. Juno rockets can provide four thrust.

### 1.4 MANEUVERING 

Location cards have maneuvers, showing where a spacecraft can go from that location. Each maneuver has a difficulty number — the higher the difficulty, the more thrust required to perform the maneuver.  A token representing a spacecraft on the Lunar Orbit location card. 

From Lunar Orbit, there are only two places one can go: out to Earth Orbit with a difficulty of three, or down to the Moon with a difficulty of two.* The difficulty of a maneuver is the amount of thrust required to propel each unit of mass. In other words, to propel a mass of one from Lunar Orbit to the Moon, requires a thrust of two. To propel that same mass to Earth Orbit would require a thrust of three. This gives us a simple formula: 

thrust required = mass × difficulty 

If the spacecraft were more massive it would require more thrust. If the maneuver were more difficult it would require more thrust. In this demonstration the spacecraft has a mass of two. To reach Earth Orbit would require a thrust of six. 2 mass × 3 difficulty = 6 thrust required To reach the Moon would require a thrust of four. 2 mass × 2 difficulty = 4 thrust required Looking at its components we can see that it has a Juno rocket capable of providing four thrust: enough to reach the Moon. Rockets are single-use components; each rocket can only be fired once, then jettisoned. 

 It is time to land the demonstration spacecraft on the Moon. Remove the Juno rocket from its components, providing four thrust.*(* In this demonstration it is assumed that all rockets always function correctly. During the actual game (page 19) this is not always the case.)
 Move the spacecraft token from Lunar Orbit CARD to the Moon CARD. There and Back This leaves the demonstration spacecraft stranded on the Moon without any rockets for a return trip. What if we had wanted to return to orbit after landing on the Moon? If the spacecraft were still in Lunar Orbit, how many rockets would be required to land on the Moon and then return to orbit? Put the spacecraft back in Lunar Orbit with a probe and two rockets. Now it has a mass of three. Landing on the Moon has a difficulty of two, so a thrust of six is required. 

3 mass × 2 difficulty = 6 thrust required 

To produce that much thrust, we shall have to expend both rockets for the maneuver.†(† This provides a total thrust of eight, which is sufficient. One can always maneuver with more thrust than required; one cannot maneuver with less. ) This leaves us on the Moon with just a probe — no way to return to orbit. Let us try once more; put the spacecraft back in Lunar Orbit, but this time with a probe and three rockets. With a mass of four, this craft will require a thrust of eight to land on the Moon. Expending two rockets gives us a thrust of eight, enabling us to land. 4 mass × 2 difficulty = 8 thrust required This leaves us with a mass of two, with one rocket remaining. Expending this rocket provides a thrust of four: just enough to return to Lunar Orbit. 2 mass × 2 difficulty = 4 thrust required  

Maneuvering is the core of Leaving Earth. Before moving on to the next chapter, be sure that you have a firm grasp on the concepts of mass, thrust, and maneuver difficulty, understanding how to expend rockets to perform maneuvers. During the actual game, several other problems can affect maneuvering — exploding rockets, dangerous environments, etc. — these are ignored in the demonstration above. (See Maneuvering on ON YOUR TURN chapter)

## 2. SETUP

Follow the directions below to set up the game. The exact layout of the table is not important, as long as the cards are visible to all players. It may be helpful to have one player act as banker, handing out cards as needed.

### 2.1 SPACE AGENCIES Each player chooses a space agency card representing a country, then takes that agency’s four spacecraft cards and matching spacecraft tokens.

### 2.2 MISSIONS Mission cards represent the goals of the game. They come in three difficulty levels: easy, medium, and hard. The back of a mission card shows which it is. Separate the mission cards into three separate decks by level, then shuffle each deck. For a normal game, draw four easy missions and two medium missions. Lay them out on the table so everyone can see what the goals are, then put the rest of the missions back in the box. If the players would like a more or less challenging game, here are some suggested sets of missions to draw instead: 

easy game 5 easy 
normal game 4 easy, 2 medium 
hard game 3 easy, 3 medium, 2 hard 
very hard game 1 easy, 4 medium, 4 hard 

### 2.3 LOCATIONS At the start of the game, all that is known about the Solar System is what can be seen from telescopes on Earth. Some things (like the orbit of the Moon) are well understood, while other things (like what one might find on the Moon) are not. Examine the location cards. Some locations are represented with a single card — these are places understood by modern science. Other locations are represented with several different cards — these are places that we know very little about. Arrange the location cards on the table according to the diagram on the next page.* Explorable locations (such as the Moon) have multiple cards with the same name; separate these into stacks by location.

Turn all the Moon cards so the side marked “unexplored” is up. Shuffle them, then draw one, but do not turn it over, leaving the “unexplored” side up. Put that one on the table in its place with the other locations. Put the other Moon cards back in the box without looking at them. This way no one will know what the Moon is like until it is explored. Do the same for each of the other explorable locations: Mars, Phobos, Ceres, Venus, Solar Radiation, and Suborbital Flight.

### 2.3 CARDS, ETC. Separate the component cards by type and set them out in stacks. Do the same with advancements, which represent engineering progress in the Space Race. Shuffle the outcomes, which show how well advancements function. Leave a space next to the outcome deck for discarded outcomes. The small hourglass-shaped objects are time tokens, used to mark how much time is remaining on a long journey; set them out in a pile. Set out the money by denomination. There is also an eight-sided die; place that on the table as well. The calendar shows the span of the game, from 1956 to 1976. Place the calendar marker on 1956 when the game begins. The game ends at the end of 1976.


## 3. MISSIONS

I n the exploration of space there are many milestones, many accomplishments to be done by the most daring explorers. These accomplishments are represented by mission cards, each worth a certain number of points to whomever completes it. Completing the most valuable missions is the goal of the game. At the beginning of the game a random set of missions will be selected. Upon completing a mission, take the mission card and keep it by your space agency card. All other space agencies immediately receive $10; your accomplishment represents a threat to their success, provoking their governments to provide additional funding.* At the end of the game the space agency with the most points will be the winner. As the Solar System is explored, some missions might turn out to be impossible. If a mission becomes impossible it is removed from the game.† If a mission requires something to reach “space”, note that all locations other than Earth are in space, including Suborbital Flight.


Completing a mission is not optional. If you are the first to meet the conditions for a mission, you must take the card and the other players must collect $10. † Only remove a mission if the location making it impossible has been revealed for everyone to see. For example, if Venus is impossible to land on and Venus has been revealed, the Venus Lander mission is removed from the game.

### 3.1 Probe The simplest missions are to send a probe somewhere. These can be accomplished with the probe component — which is lightweight and inexpensive — or with any of the capsules. The probe/capsule must be undamaged, and it must not be destroyed upon reaching its destination.* For example, if the probe or capsule is destroyed by a landing failure or by hazardous conditions at its destination, it cannot be used to complete a probe mission.

### 3.2 Survey Survey missions are completed by the space agency that first reveals an unexplored location to all the other players. This can be done by traveling to that location, or it can be done from a distance with the Surveying advancement. (See Exploration on page 30.) 

### 3.3 Sample Return Samples can be collected from the surface of any solid body — that is, a planet, a moon, or an asteroid. Sample return missions are completed by the first space agency to bring such a sample back to Earth. (See Collecting Samples on page 31.) 

### 3.4 Manned Space Flight Manned space flight is difficult and dangerous, but it is very prestigious. Such missions require that an astronaut be sent to a location and brought back to Earth again. The astronaut does not need to be in good health upon his return, as long as he gets home alive.† A note for the modern reader: considering the language of the 1950s, a “man” is any astronaut, gender notwithstanding.

### 3.5 Space Station Long-term survival in space is difficult, requiring supplies and life support. The first space agency to keep an astronaut alive in space from one year to the next completes a space station mission. (Note that there is no requirement to bring this astronaut home.)

### 3.6 Extraterrestrial Life There is a chance that life exists somewhere else in the Solar System. To complete the Extraterrestrial Life mission, bring a sample back to Earth from a location that has been revealed to have life

### 3.7 START-OF-YEAR MISSIONS Most missions are completed during one’s turn, but a few are completed at the start of a year. For example, to complete Space Station, one must have an astronaut in space at the start of a year. It is possible for multiple space agencies to complete such a mission at the start of the same year. In such a case, the mission card is awarded to the agency with the fewest points, breaking any tie randomly. As usual, the agencies who were not awarded the mission card receive $10.* * In rare cases, there may be multiple missions completed by multiple players at the start of the same year. When this happens, award the missions in order from least valuable to most valuable. For example, if Space Station and Lunar Station are completed at the start of the same year, determine which agency receives Space Station first (as it is worth fewer points), then determine which agency receives Lunar Station.

## 4. EACH YEAR

Each year begins with receiving new funding, then examining start-of-year missions. Space agencies may then take as many turns as they like, going around the table in order until they are all finished, then the year ends. At the end of the year a few other tasks take place. 

### 4.1 Funding At the beginning of each year, all space agencies receive their annual funding. Each agency turns in any money it has left from the previous year, then receives $25 in funding. 

### 4.2 Start-of-Year Missions Check to see if any start-of-year missions have been completed (page 13). 

### 4.3 Turn Order The space agency with the lowest score takes the first turn, then the agency to their left, and so on around the table until everyone has taken as many turns as they like. (See On Your Turn on page 17.) To determine a player’s score, add up the point value of any missions completed, then subtract two points for each astronaut lost. (These shall be kept tucked under the edge of the player’s space agency card.) If there is a tie for lowest score — such as at the beginning of the game — each agency with the lowest score rolls the die. Whoever rolls the lowest number takes the first turn.

### 4.4 End of Year Once all agencies have had as many turns as they like, the year ends. At this time, there are four things to do: 1. On Earth, repair all damaged components and heal all incapacitated astronauts by turning them face up. 2. Check to see if astronauts off Earth survive (described below). 3. Move the calendar marker to the next year. If the next year is off the end of the calendar, the game ends at this time. 4. Remove one time token from each spacecraft that has any. Off-Earth Survival Astronauts in space require three things: 1. good health 2. life support 3. supplies If even a single one of these is missing, astronauts will die; space is an unforgiving place. (Astronauts on Earth automatically survive.) 1. Any astronaut that is still incapacitated at the end of the year dies. If a capsule is damaged the astronauts on board die. 2. Each agency draws an outcome card from its Life Support advancement for each capsule that agency has in space to see if life support works. If life support fails, or if the agency does not have the Life Support advancement, all astronauts in that capsule die.* (See Research on page 18.) 3. Supplies represent food and other consumables. Each card of supplies feeds up to five astronauts, so five or fewer astronauts on a spacecraft consume only a single unit of supplies. Any astronaut who is not fed dies. * If there are multiple capsules in a single spacecraft, and some successfully provide life support while others do not, the agency may decide which astronauts on board survive and which do not, as long as there are enough seats in capsules with life support for the surviving astronauts.

If an astronaut dies at any time, he shall be tucked under his space agency card. There he may be remembered as a brave hero who gave his life for the exploration of space, though he also counts for a loss of two points. Supplies: Ones and Fives Some of the supply cards are labeled Supplies 5×. These are exactly equivalent to five regular supply cards, weighing and costing five times as much. Five Supplies 1× cards can be exchanged for one Supplies 5× card, or vice versa, at any time. END OF GAME Years continue until one of these happens: • The calendar marker moves past the end of 1976. • One space agency has enough points to be unbeatable. • There are no more missions left to be completed. At the end of the game, the winner is the agency with the most points

## 5. ON YOUR TURN

At the end of your turn, automatic maneuvers take place (page 23).* Research an advancement. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 19 Buy a component. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 21 Assemble a spacecraft. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 22 Disassemble a spacecraft . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 22 Perform a maneuver . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 23 Dock one spacecraft to another . . . . . . . . . . . . . 27 Separate one spacecraft in two. . . . . . . . . . . . . . 27 Survey unexplored conditions. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 30 Collect a sample from an extraterrestrial body . . . . . . 30 Repair a damaged component. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 32 Heal an incapacitated astronaut. . . . . . . . . . . . . . 32 Co-operate with another agency. . . . . . . . . . . . . . 32

* Note that automatic maneuvers (like falling back to Earth from Suborbital Flight) happen at the end of your turn, not at the end of the year.

### 5.1 RESEARCH Scientific advancements let you do things you could not do otherwise, like build a Saturn rocket or dock two spacecraft together: Juno rocket Use Juno rockets. atlas rocket Use Atlas rockets. Soyuz rocket Use Soyuz rockets. Saturn rocket Use Saturn rockets. ion thruster Use ion thrusters. rendezvous Dock to join two spacecraft together, or separate one spacecraft into two. re-entry Enter atmosphere without burning up your capsules. landing Land where the atmosphere is too thin for effective parachutes. life support Let astronauts survive in space from one year to the next. surveying Explore a location from a distance. Whenever an advancement is used it has some chance of success and some chance of failure. This is represented with outcome cards sitting on the advancement.

The three types of outcome cards: MAJOR FAILURE (PAY $5 TO REMOVE AFTER EFFECTS), MINOR FAILURE (PAY $5 TO REMOVE AFTER EFFECTS), SUCCESS (PAY $10 TO REMOVE AFTER SUCCESS)

### 5.1.1 RESEARCHING AN ADVANCEMENT To research an advancement, pay $10, then take the advancement card and place it in front of you. Check the card to see how many outcome cards it requires; draw that many outcomes without looking at them and set them on top of the advancement.*

### 5.2 DRAWING AN OUTCOME When you attempt to use an ability listed on an advancement, look at a random outcome from that advancement. The usual way to do this is to hand the outcomes to another player; that player shuffles the outcomes and fans them out, face down, then you draw one and reveal it to everyone. Put the other outcomes back on top of the advancement. Check the advancement card to see the result of the outcome you drew: your attempt might be a success or it might be some type of failure.† If there are no outcomes on the advancement, the attempt is automatically a success.

If the advancement card says that the outcome causes a component to be damaged, keep in mind that astronauts do count as components, so they can be incapacitated by such outcomes. Samples and supplies do not have a damaged side, so they cannot be chosen as components to be damaged.

If it is a failure of any sort, you may pay $5 to remove it, putting it face up on the stack of discarded outcomes. If it is a success, you may pay $10 to remove it. If you do not remove the outcome, put it back on top of the advancement with the other outcomes. Paying to remove an outcome card does not change what happened this time; it simply removes it from the advancement’s outcomes so that it will not be drawn again in the future. If there is only one outcome left on an advancement, when you draw it, you may leave it face up on the advancement. If it is a success, you may remove it for free. Never draw multiple outcome cards at once. If you are doing something that requires you to draw multiple outcomes, you must deal with each one in turn before proceeding to the next. For example, if you fire two Atlas rockets you must draw one outcome, face the results, then either shuffle it back onto the advancement or pay to remove it, and then draw the second outcome.

TYPES OF FAILURES There are two types of failure outcome cards: Minor Failure and Major Failure. What effect these have depends on the advancement they were drawn from

Rockets - minor failure:  Rocket is damaged and provides no thrust  ||| major failure: Spacecraft is destroyed.
ion thruster - minor failure:  Thruster is damaged and provides no thrust.  ||| major failure: Thruster is damaged and provides no thrust
rendezvous - minor failure:  Docking/separating fails, and one component of your choice is damaged.  ||| major failure: Docking/separating fails, and one component of your choice is damaged.
re-entry - minor failure:  Capsule is damaged, but occupants survive.  ||| major failure: Capsule is destroyed along with occupants.
landing- minor failure: One component of your choice is damaged.   ||| major failure: Spacecraft is destroyed.
life support- minor failure:  Occupants die.  ||| major failure: Occupants die.
surveying - minor failure: Location remains unexplored.   ||| major failure: Location remains unexplored.

### 5.3 COMPONENTS Most components have a price listed on them; pay that amount to buy the component, then set it on the table in front of you. Samples do not have a price listed, so they do not cost anything, but they can only be collected from extraterrestrial bodies; they cannot be bought. Some components have a required advancement listed on them — Juno rockets, for example, require the Juno advancement. If you do not have the required advancement, you cannot buy the component. If a component has no number listed for any of its attributes (such as mass or thrust) it has a value of zero. For example, astronauts have no mass listed; their mass is therefore zero.

Damaged and Undamaged Note that components generally have a good side and a damaged side. When you buy a component it starts out undamaged, shown by having the good side facing up. Supplies and samples do not have a damaged side because they cannot be damaged. Astronauts do count as components, and they can received damage, though damaged astronauts are referred to as incapacitated. Some outcomes require you to choose one component from a spacecraft and damage it. When this happens, you must choose an undamaged component and damage it — you cannot damage a damaged component. Supplies and samples do not have a damaged side, so you must choose a different component to receive the damage.*

If an outcome requires you to damage a component, yet all of the components on board are already damaged (or cannot take damage), the spacecraft is destroyed.

### 5.4 SPACECRAFT ASSEMBLY To assemble a spacecraft, gather up some of your components, a spacecraft card, and the matching spacecraft token. Stack the components on the spacecraft card and place the token on Earth. To disassemble a spacecraft on Earth, do the same in reverse: take the components off the spacecraft card, take the token off Earth, and set the spacecraft card aside. To add an astronaut to a spacecraft, there must be a seat available. Each capsule has only a certain number of seats, shown with an astronaut icon.

### 5.5 MANEUVERING A maneuver is a route from one location to another. It has a particular difficulty, and it may have other symbols as well. To perform a maneuver a spacecraft must generate thrust. The thrust required must be at least the mass of the spacecraft times the difficulty of the maneuver. thrust required = mass × difficulty Discard rockets from the spacecraft to generate the thrust listed on them, and/or fire ion thrusters (page 26). When you fire a rocket or an ion thruster, draw an outcome card from your advancement for that rocket/thruster to see if it is successful.* (If you do not have an advancement for that rocket/thruster — because someone else gave you a component that you could not purchase — you gain the advancement automatically at this time, along with a full set of outcomes on it, just as if you had researched the advancement yourself.) Once you have generated enough thrust, move the spacecraft token to the new location card. A spacecraft with time tokens on it (see below) cannot perform a maneuver, as it is already in the middle of a long maneuver.

AUTOMATIC MANEUVERS A few maneuvers have an exclamation mark instead of a difficulty. These are automatic maneuvers. If a spacecraft is in a location with an automatic maneuver at the end of your turn, it performs that maneuver. You may deliberately perform such a maneuver during your turn if you like — no thrust is required. If a maneuver leads to Lost, the spacecraft is destroyed.†

### 5.6 MULTI-YEAR MANEUVERS An hourglass symbol represents a maneuver that cannot be completed in a single year. When performing such a maneuver, generate thrust as usual, then move the spacecraft token to its destination. For each , put a time token on the spacecraft card. At the end of each year, one time token will be removed from the spacecraft card. While a spacecraft has even a single time token on it, it cannot perform a maneuver, survey a location, dock with another spacecraft, or collect a sample, as it has not actually arrived at its destination yet. Once all time tokens are removed from the spacecraft, it has arrived, and can perform actions as usual. A few maneuvers have a time symbol in parentheses: . These maneuvers do not require any time tokens, but you may add time tokens if you wish.* The usual reason to add time tokens where none are required is to permit the use of ion thrusters (page 26).

### 5.7 MANEUVER HAZARDS Many maneuvers present hazards to space flight, shown by symbols on the maneuver. Once you have moved your spacecraft token to its destination, the spacecraft faces any hazards present, in the following order: solar radiation , atmospheric entry , landing , then any other hazards present. Radiation Radiation is a danger to astronauts aboard a spacecraft. The level of danger depends on the length of the maneuver and on the level of radiation. When you perform a maneuver with radiation, look at the Solar Radiation card to see the radiation level. For each astronaut on board, roll the eight-sided die.† If the number rolled is less than or equal to the radiation level times the number of years of the maneuver, that astronaut becomes incapacitated. astronaut incapacitated if: 

die roll ≤ radiation level × years of maneuver

If you have multiple astronauts, be sure to say which astronaut is facing radiation before rolling the die.

For example, if an astronaut is traveling from Earth Orbit to Mars Orbit — a journey of three years — and Solar Radiation shows a level of two, a roll of six or less means the astronaut becomes incapacitated. astronaut incapacitated if: 
die roll ≤ 2 radiation × 3 years 

If an astronaut becomes incapacitated, turn him face down. He must be healed before the end of the year or he will die. (See Astronaut Skills on page 32.) Astronauts only face radiation at the start of a maneuver; do not roll the die for radiation again while the maneuver is taking place. The Aldrin capsule reduces the radiation level by one, as it contains heavy materials to shield against radiation. Atmospheric Entry Spacecraft enter the atmosphere at high speed. All damaged capsules and those without heat shields are destroyed by atmospheric entry , along with any astronauts in them.* For each working capsule with heat shields, draw an outcome from your Re-entry advancement to see what happens.† If you have multiple capsules, you must declare which astronauts are in which capsules before entering atmosphere. If a capsule is destroyed during atmospheric entry, the astronauts inside are lost, as there is no time to switch to another capsule. capsules with heat shields Apollo, Vostok capsules without heat shields Aldrin, Eagle All other components are unaffected by atmospheric entry. Landing Landing on bodies without a dense atmosphere takes skill. Draw an outcome from your Landing advancement to see what happens when you perform a maneuver with a landing hazard . If you do not have Landing, the spacecraft is destroyed. 


If you have multiple capsules, you must declare which astronauts are in which
capsules before entering atmosphere. If a capsule is destroyed during atmospheric
entry, the astronauts inside are lost, as there is no time to switch to another capsule.

Some landing maneuvers travel through a dense enough atmosphere that
one may land safely without any advancement required (as all spacecraft are
assumed to have parachutes). These are marked with . If you would rather
test Landing instead of landing safely you may do so.* This puts your spacecraft at risk of being damaged or destroyed, but it lets you
possibly improve your Landing advancement

Other Hazards
These symbols are for maneuvers that take you beyond what is known to science. To find out what happens, look at the location card with the relevant
symbol in the middle of it. (See Exploration on page 30.)
Suborbital Flight may only be explored if there is an astronaut aboard.† Upon exploring Suborbital Flight with a manned spacecraft you may choose not to
reveal the card to the other players. If you do not reveal it, any astronauts on the
spacecraft die as the conditions are assumed to be fatal.
This location hazard has no effect on unmanned spacecraft.

## 5.8 ION THRUSTERS
Ion thrusters are not like conventional rockets; they can be used again and
again, so do not discard them after using them. Instead of producing a fixed
amount of thrust like a rocket, ion thrusters produce a certain amount of thrust
per year of travel. For example, if you have a thruster that puts out five thrust
per year, and the maneuver takes three years, the thruster may be used to
produce fifteen thrust.
Ion thrusters can only be used for maneuvers that take at least one year. As
a result, you cannot fire ion thrusters at all for many maneuvers, such as from
the Moon to Lunar Orbit.

## 5.9 FASTER AND SLOWER MANEUVERS
A maneuver can be completed faster than listed by using more thrust. Double
the difficulty to complete it in half as many years, rounded up. For example,
the maneuver from Earth Orbit to Mars Fly-By normally has a difficulty of three and takes three years. It can be completed faster: double the difficulty
(six) and half the time, rounded up (two years). This can even be repeated,
permitting a maneuver to Mars Fly-By with a difficulty of twelve, taking only
one year.* * Though a maneuver with a difficulty of twelve poses its own problems.
Maneuvers of at least one year can be completed slower than listed, but
the difficulty remains the same. The usual reason to do this is to permit ion
thrusters more time to generate thrust. (See Ion Thrusters on page 26.)

## 5.10 OUTER PLANETS
A few maneuvers are labeled Outer,
leading to the Outer Planets Transfer
point. This location does not exist in
the base game, so these maneuvers
cannot be used. Traveling to the
outer planets should be possible in
an upcoming expansion to Leaving
Earth.

## 5.11 RENDEZVOUS
With the Rendezvous advancement
you can dock two spacecraft together,
making them into a single craft. The
two spacecraft must be in the same
location, and they must both have
no time tokens on them. Draw an
outcome from Rendezvous to see if
the attempt is successful.
Take all the components off of
one and place them on the spacecraft card of the other. Remove the
empty spacecraft’s token from the location

Separating works the same way in reverse: choose a spacecraft, draw an
outcome from Rendezvous, if successful split the spacecraft in two.
You cannot dock or separate on Earth or in Suborbital Flight. You cannot
dock if either spacecraft has any time tokens on it, but a spacecraft with time
tokens can separate.* After separation, both of the resulting spacecraft have as many time tokens as the
original spacecraft.
Remember that astronauts must have a seat in a capsule. If a separation
would result in an astronaut not having a seat, the separation cannot take place.

## 5.12 EXPLORATION
Some locations begin the game unexplored. These locations correspond to
maneuver hazards, such as the Moon and its maneuver hazard . If you
have a spacecraft that survives to face such a maneuver hazard, look at the
other side of the location card to see what happens.† If there are other hazards on this maneuver, such as landing or atmospheric entry,
face those first. Only a craft that survives all other hazards may deploy its scientific
instruments to analyze local conditions. Once you have seen it,
you may either turn it face
up, revealing it to everyone, or else your spacecraft
is destroyed. Each location will be one of the following types:

barren - These locations have no particular effects.
Spacecraft Destroyed - Any spacecraft going to this location is destroyed.
minerals - Samples collected from these locations may be turned in for
money once they are brought back to Earth.
supplies - Supplies used for feeding astronauts (page 32) and
repairing damaged components (page 15) may be collected at these locations.
sickness / radiation - Astronauts may become incapacitated, either from space
flight itself or from solar radiation (page 24).
life - If the Extraterrestrial Life mission is available, bringing a
sample from there back to Earth will complete the mission.
alien origin - Phobos may turn out to be hollow and metallic, of some
unexplained alien origin. In that case, samples from there
will yield new scientific knowledge when turned in back
on Earth. If you turn in such a sample, you may gain a
new advancement with no outcome cards on it, or you may
remove all outcome cards from any one of your existing
advancements (page 18).


The Surveying advancement lets you use a working probe or capsule to survey
the conditions at an unexplored location. Whenever you have a probe or capsule in a location with a maneuver that has an exploration hazard, you may use
Surveying to look at the other side of the location card.* You may test your Surveying by exploring areas that have already been explored.

You may turn it face
up if you like, revealing it to everyone — even if you do not, your spacecraft
is still safe. For example, a probe or capsule in Mars Orbit can survey Solar
Radiation, Mars, and Phobos. You cannot survey with a spacecraft that still
has time tokens.
Suborbital Flight is an exception. It cannot be surveyed; it can only be
explored by sending an astronaut there.

## 5.13 COLLECTING SAMPLES
All solid bodies (planets, moons, and asteroids) permit a spacecraft to collect
samples, if the spacecraft has an undamaged probe, an undamaged capsule, or
a healthy astronaut. To collect a sample simply take the relevant sample card
and add it to the spacecraft.
Some explorable locations permit a spacecraft to collect supplies as well.
To do so, the spacecraft must have an undamaged probe/capsule/astronaut,
and the location must be revealed for all players to see.
A spacecraft with any time tokens on it has not yet reached its destination,
therefore it can collect neither samples nor supplies.

## 5.14 ASTRONAUT SKILLS

Most astronauts have a specialty: mechanic , doctor , or pilot . This
gives them some special capabilities, but only if they are in good health. An
incapacitated astronaut cannot use his skills.
Mechanics
An astronaut with the symbol can repair all damaged components on his
spacecraft (other than astronauts) by consuming one supply.
If a minor failure is drawn from Life Support while a mechanic is aboard,
the failure acts as a success, causing Life Support to function. A major failure,
however, still acts as a failure. (No matter how it acts, a failure can still be
removed for only $5 when drawn.)
Doctors
An astronaut with the symbol can heal all incapacitated astronauts on his
spacecraft for free. He cannot heal himself.
Pilots
An astronaut with the symbol improves the effects of outcomes drawn from
Landing and Rendezvous: a minor failure acts as a success and a major failure
acts as a minor failure. (No matter how it acts, a failure can still be removed
for only $5 when drawn.)

## 6. MISSION PLANNING

Successful missions are generally planned
in advance. A very important part of planning is determining which rockets are required
to carry a payload to its destination.* * A payload is whatever a rocket carries to its destination. This can
be done easily using two tools: the maximum
payload chart (which is on each space agency
card) and some note paper.
The maximum payload chart shows how much mass a rocket can carry for
any given maneuver difficulty:

rocket type
Juno Atlas Soyuz Saturn
maneuver difficulty
1 3 23 71 180
2 1 9 1/2 31 80
3  1/3 5 17 2/3 46 2/3
4 2 3/4 11 30
5 1 2/5 7 20
6  1/2 4 1/3 13 1/3
7 2 3/7 8 4/7
8 1 5
9 2 2/9

For example, let us assume we have a payload with a mass of one in Lunar
Orbit to move to the Moon: a maneuver with a difficulty of two. The row for
two difficulty shows that a Juno rocket can carry a payload with a mass of one
on such a maneuver.
Missions are easiest to plan in reverse. Let us assume we are sending a
probe from Earth to the Moon. The final stage will be the descent from Lunar
Orbit to the Moon. Before that is the transfer from Earth Orbit to Lunar Orbit.
Before that, the easiest route uses two stages to travel from Earth into Earth
Orbit

The final stage is at the top, where the lunar probe
descends to the Moon, a payload of one unit of mass.
The lunar transfer stage getting to Lunar Orbit must
carry not only the probe, but also the Juno rocket for the
descent, therefore it has a payload of two.
The maximum payload chart shows that, for a
maneuver difficulty of three and a payload mass of two,
the best solution is an Atlas rocket. This means that the
lunar transfer stage has a rocket mass of four.

Each stage must carry everything for the later stages as
its payload. The payload for the stage to orbit is the
lunar transfer stage's payload mass plus its rocket mass: 

a total mass of six. Carrying a payload of six on a maneuver of five difficulty
can be done with a Soyuz rocket. This means the stage to orbit has a rocket
mass of nine, as shown on the Soyuz card.
The last stage to be planned is the first stage of the mission: launch. This
stage must carry the payload and rocket of the previous stage, so its payload
mass is fifteen. To carry a payload of fifteen on a maneuver of three requires
another Soyuz rocket

, leaving us with the following stages:
maneuver diff.
payload
mass rockets
rocket
mass
lunar descent 2 1 juno 1
lunar transfer 3 2 atlas 4
to orbit 5 6 soyuz 9
launch 3 15 soyuz 9

This mission will therefore require two Soyuz rockets, an Atlas rocket, and a
Juno rocket, along with the probe — the actual payload headed to the Moon.

LUNAR DIRECT
Let us try this stage-planning method for a larger mission: carrying an astronaut to the Moon and back. Returning to Earth will require a capsule that
can re-enter the atmosphere, so we shall use a Vostok capsule: a payload with
a mass of two. To follow along, use some component cards and the maximum
payload chart found on the space agency cards.
The maneuvers required for this mission are: launch (3), orbit (5), lunar
transfer (3), lunar descent (2), lunar ascent (2), Earth transfer (3), and atmospheric re-entry (0). We can ignore the re-entry stage, as it has a difficulty of
zero, so it requires no rockets. Writing these out in reverse order, our planning
sheet looks like this:

maneuver diff.
payload
mass rockets
rocket
mass
earth transfer 3 2
lunar ascent 2
lunar descent 2
lunar transfer 3
to orbit 5
launch 3

RENDEZVOUS
The Rendezvous advancement can be used for much more efficient missions.
In our previous example, we described a spacecraft traveling all the way to
the surface of the Moon and back, carrying a heavy Vostok capsule the entire
way. Yet such a heavy capsule is only required for the final maneuver, entering
into Earth's atmosphere. What if this capsule were left behind in Earth Orbit,
while the astronaut traveled in a much lighter Eagle capsule to the Moon?

maneuver diff.
payload
mass rockets
rocket
mass
earth transfer 3 1 3 juno 3
lunar ascent 2 4 atlas 4
lunar descent 2 8 atlas 4
lunar transfer 3 12 soyuz 9
2 (vostok left in earth orbit)
to orbit 5 23 saturn, soyuz 29
launch 3 52 saturn,
atlas, juno 25

With an Earth-Orbit–rendezvous, this mission is a little bit lighter and a little
bit cheaper than the direct mission we considered earlier. This is only one of
the ways rendezvous can be used to make a more efficient mission.

SOLITAIRE
If there is only one space agency in the game, the race is against time, rather
than against other agencies. Play through the full twenty years, attempting
to earn as many points as you can. If, at the end of the game, you have more
points than there are in uncompleted missions, you win the game.* For a
satisfying solitaire game, it is recommended to play a hard or very hard game.
(See Missions on page 8.)
